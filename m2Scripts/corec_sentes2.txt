 where are you ?
 is very often the first question that you will be asked when possible the phone .
 why ?
 because somebody has invented the most popular communication .
 the mobile phone .
 once heavy , expensive and not reliable , the new mobile phone machines in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers .
 due to the mobile phone .
 communication has changed , not improved .
 of course it allows to be reached everywhere ( even in places you would n't want ) .
 for practical , it is a great help .
 but is n't it a robotic outside life .
 should n't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 0 actions away .
 it is not rare to see two people walking by side , both talking on the phone .
 would n't be better to prepare the shopping list instead of a home to ask what patience to buy .
 mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for peace , we should right on it .
 peace : use of this advice may damage .
 dear mrs smith
 i am writing to reply to your letter you wrote me in june 00 june .
 firstly , i would like to tell you that the group has been booked into which works , which is beside beside the house house house in the centre .
 you can make contact with mrs exercise using the number 00 0000000 .
 secondly , the best way from the hotel to the development is to take the bus , which is especially organized by us .
 the bus leaves leaves at 0:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 0 o'clock in the evening .
 of course there 's also a bus number 0 in front of the hotel is also suitable , but it leaves only half an hour .
 the end - of - called party , which happened in the evening on 00 june , is going to be held on the entrance .
 beside the barbecue , there are some well - known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night .
 what 's more is that there 's a math band came to make the party more colourful .
 it plays from 00:00 to 00:00 , while the students can enjoy it with dancing .
 the main events of the party will end up at about 00:00 in the night .
 as you see , what to wear is just something casual .

 computers life
 now - a day computer can be found in almost every corner , in offices , in shops .
 or even in cars and was recommended there 're a computer company .
 what has a computer affected to our life ?
 first of all , the efficiency of society has been improved .
 when shopping , we do n't need to wait the ticket to take every article 's note by hand .
 when booking a cheque , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get done it done in one minute .
 secondly , instead of looking up of books to get the information that we need , we can very easily find it from the internet or on the local network .
 it 's a very often heard that someone , who has a special illness , losing by a foreign item , which he find the internet .
 moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , controlling operations or having a teenager .
 lastly the way of communications has also been changed .
 instead of the venue , we can talk , or even see each other with the help of computer network .
 of course there 're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved .
 for example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on papers .
 a very important and problem is the reliability and security .
 till now , to completely rely on computers is still somehow not safe enough .
 in conclusion , computer have become a very essential side of our life , and it 's still a young invention , which need to be improved improved .

 the telephone is a very important invention , which has affected our lives .
 it is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places .
 people use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life .
 in my opinion people need a telephone .
 for example , a telephone is very important in job - life .
 nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone .
 also it is god for people 's safety .
 you can call the police if you are in danger or the future if you are injured .
 people use the telephone also for their personal life .
 for example , when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
 another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
 they are able to give us and receive information very quickly .
 this invention has made our lives easier and quickly lighter .
 the telephone has made my own life also easy and quick .
 it makes something possible you can not do .
 finally i would say that the telephone is very glad for people .

 television has become so important for us that we ca n't think that it could n't exist .

 best regards ,
 to my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car .
 cars take a big part in our life .
 everywhere you look you can see cars .
 more and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time to travelling travelling travelling travelling from public transport .
 cars are also more reliable than other types of transport .
 you do n't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some hours , you can just into a car , your radio break and rented a shower company you have rented to get a piece of your taste to do your financial item .
 cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is wet ill .
 could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire - had to get somewhere quickly on foot ?
 i do n't think i need to comment on this .
 from my personal experience i realised how it 's important to drive a car when i was living in south world in south africa south africa .
 i arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 0 months old and i could n't drive at that time .
 fortunately biko is a very dangerous place to live .
 i could n't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous .
 there was no public transport and i had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or doctors or the anywhere else .
 there i soon realised that i had to learn how to drive if i wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
 since i spent my driving i can not understand how i used to live without a car before .
 i use my car every day everywhere i go and i abolutely it !
 00th june 0000
 dear mrs smith ,
 i am writing to give you some information about the international student 's student .
 first of all , the hotel which the group has been booked to is the hotel .
 it is very near japanese station , which you can get there easily .
 by peace : get off at york and you can walk from the station left left and the hotel is on your left hand hand hand hand hand .
 by bus : most of the buses in the city centre passes the station , or you can take a taxi .
 secondly , the reason is very important event for all of us , we agreed to wear formal dresses .
 for example , men should wear suits , robbers and the so on .
 in addition , at the end - of - word party , we also have a country show .
 it could be very special because all the dancers are from our group .
 finally , on the last day we have an afternoon free .
 it would be great if we could go for a walk around the city of york and visiting the redecoration buildings .
 if you could think of any other ideas it would be very kind of you . i would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you .

 inventions have affected all our lives !
 nowadays , a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days .
 a car is one of the invention which is very useful .
 i think a car is very important to me because it 's very convenient for everyday life .
 for example , i can travel to many places in the u.k. , i live in front - on the hill - shirt ( a village nearing into spain ) .
 can you imagine if i did n't get a car how could i go shopping , go to college and so on ?
 in fact , there are buses ( number and 000 ) which go my village but the bus is very expensive for me .
 apart from that it takes long time to go somewhere somewhere .
 the car has a fax affected my own life .
 i can go anywhere by car a lot than use public transport .
 i can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to the music , which i brought some cases with me with me from thailand .
 i took a car driving build tests last mad and i passed it and i will take a shower test test test very soon .
 i think i have to drive the car myself , so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car .
 in conclusion , i think car is very important to me and it has affected my own life .
 if i have more money i will buy another car . i think it will have more advantages than disadvantages .
 so , we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car !

 because all of them are so important in difference ways .
 as now i 'm being away from home , telephone is very important to me .

 to hear the voice from the person you love is the advertisement saying that hard to describe , it 's wonderful and so really , you can imagine their face .
 i had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in front via e - mail .
 the problem is the language , we used english but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us to each other .
 however , the problem resolved by a telephone .
 we are now still friends .
 thanks to the invention of the telephone .
 dear mrs smith
 with reference to the information that you had requested , the hotel that had been booked is the holiday , in new york and to get to the university of which is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a thief , clearly friday problems where the paparazzi and moreover , which is the main student to come on the main fruits , you need to do the places , which you do the student , which you do the cinema of the places of the places of the places .
 concerning the party at the end of the fame , this will be formal there will need formal , as you know there will be a company , entertainment , managers etc .
 as for the last day i suggest you take a visit to the ticket programme and the list 's castle .
 in the programme you will find a very interesting chat of roman east , also you can visit another section which it lets it was a library .
 yours sincerely ,
 i always had consider myself was very look forward to be born in the century because all the microphones tells .
 as an example let 's have a look and we will see this trip how it has developed .
 we just need to think about the first world and all the inventions thanks to the industrial revolution of the industrial revolution to these day .
 however , i feel that at the moment there should surely more gr to control this development because the industrial atmosphere that it has been created and it seems that its little what has been made at the moment in our development to our environment .
 i hope in the future there will be more and more people interested in this important solutions .
 dear mrs maria smith ,
 i read your letters and i 'm ready to help you .
 i think that we have to think which hotel is better for students .
 i have an idea and i think that you will agree with me .
 i was thinking about the musicians because it 's very nice and cheap .
 it has comfortable winters and location for parties .
 you can book this hotel it 's the best and it 's near to believe it 's only 00 minutes by walk .
 i think that it will be nice about the end - of profit party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy the seaside and to dance .
 the party it will be nice .
 the clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to pay for example , nice casual , not with shoes or shirts - shirts .
 on the last day in the afternoon that you have three hours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places .
 those are my ideas for the basis .
 i hope that you will like it .
 yours sincerely ,
 today our article it will be about an inventions that we need in the accurate life .
 i think that all these things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things .
 first of all , we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to call if you need something of something happened to your house and nobody is next to you .
 the second thing is the lamp , the electricity that is very important in our life .
 in the past the people did n't have a toaster and if they wanted for example to read or cook something they used to do in the fire .
 it 's important to have electricity because without this you ca n't do anything .
 the other one is the television .
 you must have tv because you can understand what it happened in the world and you can watch some places that you did n't go .
 you can enjoy your time to watch a film if you have free time .
 the boat it 's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
 the car now is very important in our lives you can go wherever you want .
 in this year the changes they have 0 cars in one family one person by one person .
 for me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n't do anything , it 's part of my life .
 dear maria smith ,
 first of all , the group has been booked into the hotel .
 it is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people .
 it has a swimming pool and a nice bar .
 the hotel is ten minutes far from the practical and there will be a bus available to go directly there .
 at the end of the planes , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's not allowed .
 next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .
 we can do a lot of things in my area .
 we have the opportunity to visit the old town , it 's very nice and there is a lot of shops .
 we can visit the old castle or the painting museum too .
 i find television the most important invention .
 i think it 's good for old people because some of them can not go to the cinema anymore .
 on the one hand it 's because they do n't have enough money to pay for them 's hand because they ca n't move very well for example if they are causing .
 with television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .
 television is a good way to be informed with the news .
 i prefer being informed by television than by newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
 i think television is a good invention when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important thing to do .
 dear mrs smith ,
 i 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such an explanation .
 first of all , the group has been booked into ' the hotel ' .
 you wo n't have any problem to find the college because it 's in front of the hotel , and the executive will be there .
 as you know , the show will start at 00:00 and it will finish at 00:00 , but we will have lunch at 00:00 at 00:00 at the college 's until 00:00 .
 you 'll have to wear a white shirts and blue trousers , if you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket jacket jacket jacket .
 when we had finished you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television , but if you prefer other things , we 've got a swimming pool and a library , it will your own choice .
 i hope it was useful for you .
 yours sincerely ,

 telephone our lives
 it 's now available now to think a life without that invention quickly how quickly affects our life , especially in business .
 we ca n't imagine a big company without a phone , which can make business more quickly than anything else .
 also , i was asking too many people in the street .
 could you live without telephone ?
 the answer was all the same " information available " .
 an old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad computers in the " garbage university " university " , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the explosion .
 however , it was one month , which he told me , it was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to speak a lot , especially at christmas to wish all his friends very nice but now , now phone him a very difficult old fashion .
 in my opinion this little box " that everybody has at home can safe your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
 in conclusion do n't make a very long phone calls and you wo n't have to pay a very expensive bill .
 dear mrs maria smith
 thank you for your letter .
 it 's hell that i wo n't see a child because of his illness , but i 'm willing to help you as much as i can .
 then i will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
 firstly , about your accommodation , our college , which i belong to offers a free accommodation , with regard of facilities .
 ( for example , cars , car , free the internet access , etc etc . )
 they also are located in our newspapers so you can get to the schedule by walk .
 secondly , as you know we 'll have a party after the sunday , which will take place at our student hundred hall with some meals .
 this party is contrary to be that formal , but i recommend you do not wear jeans and untraditional .
 last , if you have free time for a couple of ours , you 'd better visit city , which is 00 minutes from our camp , by train .
 that is very traditional japanese city where so many peace and hundreds are there .
 i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe get closer with our culture .
 by the way , if you have any other questions , please send me a letter again .
 oh baby , i ca n't live without you !
 these days , we 've been surrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented invented invented .
 in our daily life , however , we 've noticed how much convenient life we 've got , which is more , how much inconvenience 's affair our grandparents had got .
 how nasty we are !
 let us try to appreciate a importance again .
 as for me , the invention which is most important thing for me is a personal computer . i have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all of us to have personal computer and use them at any times .
 when you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one and it is true for the class on politics , because you have to study on your computer , doing social set and some research .
 my task said ' and get acquainted with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
 i find it easily to forget the importance of inventions which we use any explanation without any answers .
 that 's nature to human beings .
 but , i think it 's not only our fault but the cause of how much they refused in our lives .
 dear mrs smith

 dear mrs smith ,
 i am writing in reply to your letter , which i received yesterday .
 below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student at a peaceful college and some recommendations , which might be useful for the students .
 first of all , the hotel booked for the group is the 0-week bands , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
 this is a very central hotel , not far far away from the phone hall .
 you will be able to get there either by bus ( no 000 ) or on foot .
 next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the schedule .
 it will begin at the following p.m. and may last the whole night .
 people are going to be there and it would be a good idea to wear fashionable - coloured clothes .
 finally i think that you should jump at the opportunity to go to the historical 's museum before leaving .
 some of the most amazing cases are delightful there .
 i wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in a shower .
 yours sincerely

 below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
 0 . architecture
 the architecture of the building itself is really breathtaking in terms of oxygen and kres comfortably .
 even if the fifteenth style may seem a bit ' heavy , this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
 0 . 0
 although i have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day , it is such a shirt and close time that people had never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section section section of the museum .
 0 . restaurant
 the ticket restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
 the waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice .
 in fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum .
 to sum up , i would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums , because you can not only wonderful hours but also a very exhausting architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to .
 dear mrs. smith ,
 in reply to your letter , i would like to answer your questions and give you more information .
 firstly , the hotel in which the group is going to stay is ' - hotel ' .
 secondly , the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the chinese is by a local bus .
 there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and no sentences , or 0 will take you directly to the fame .
 thirdly , the end - of - called party will be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided .
 therefore , you could wear something quite casual .

 i hope this letter should help you with enough information .
 yours sincerely ,
 could modern people live without a light ?
 well , i do n't think so .
 only people who could live without it , it must be extremely weird weird or somebody in a very difficult situation !
 we are always surrounded by the man - made ' light .
 with it , we read , study , walk , and so on .
 in the past people came on the adverts , peace and the light from fire .
 these were , however , very often from when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out .
 they had to read , study and walk in the dark .
 today , this kind of thing hardly happened !
 well , unless there was n't anything wrong with the power .
 i remember when i was about 0 , i visited a museum with my family .
 while i was in the toilet , all the light was turned off !
 i have slept and cried since i 'd never experienced in a complete darkness before .
 when the light was turned on again , i realised how important even a single light would be , and i was sure i can never , live without it .
 dear maria ,
 first of all , i am sorry to hear that mosquitoes is ill .
 as the phone must go on , i will give you the information you asked for in order to work on this phone .
 according to the hotel , the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place we are going to have the animals .
 the hotel is the hotel .
 it 's just for only 0 minutes walk from there to the distances and i would like to suggest that this this is the best way to get to the development .
 about the party , we will have a party at the end of the chinese is at the hotel you will stay in the end .
 the party will be in a friendly atmosphere so do n't worry about what to wear .
 there will be only our group , so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
 lastly , what you could possibly do while you will wait for three hours , for some people who want to go shopping .
 the shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel , however , some people may just to wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
 the cafe is available .
 i hope that information will be useful .
 if you have any questions i am more than happy to help .
 i look forward to seeing you in the courts .

 how would you cope with all those ?
 thank god for those who had created the electricity and had applied it into every appliances .
 the electricity is a clever invention .
 everything fell on the use of electricity , for instance from a small vending light to the most complicated complicated system which covers information !
 life would n't be easy if we did n't have electricity .
 the electricity is very important in keeping our lives go .
 no matter where you are , what you do , and , fortunately , you need the electricity .
 let 's think this way , if we did n't have the electricity , there would be no other inventions at all !
 i , personally , could n't live without the electricity .
 it has already affected and play a great role in my life .
 i watch the television and use the computer every day .
 moreover , other facilities in my house , telephone , air - air , fridge , for example , they are all need the electricity . that is why it is very important to my life .

 the next city is 00 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or a shower to go there .
 it has been quite hard to me not to have the buildings for my free time like my friends that lived in or close near the city .

 so with my car i achieved a great freedom .

 inventions have affected all our lives !
 what is it what we use every day many hours ?
 sometimes 's early in the morning until late in the evening .
 yes is the tv .
 it is well know in almost all family , often often with a lot of different languages .
 first of all , the tv can tell us news in a short time , which happened all over the world .
 another point in favour of the invention for the tv is , that they telling about interesting , for instance about animals or different cultures from other countries .
 furthermore they have a lot of different programme , usually something for everybody .
 it could also be relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work .
 finally , the tv is in my opinion very useful for getting important information . you can watching the weather and all of them were present on wonderful colour .
 to sum up , in my opinion the tv is a very good and useful invention .
 however , they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children .
 i can not imagine living without a crowded amount , it is something what we need for our education , for getting news and other helpful information .
 dear mrs smith ,

 the telephone
 could you imagine there 's no telephone , in an office ?
 or to live your life without chatting for hours with your best friend ?
 could you ?
 i ca n't !
 the telephone was invented by speakers bell into the end of the 00th century .
 it was an invention nobody thought how important and how much it would be in the future .
 nowadays almost every band in the western owns owns a telephone , and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing .
 people need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for the general information in a very short and directly way with the opportunity to answer immediately .
 when i was a child , we had no telephone at home , and i always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village .
 now i have my own flat , and the first piece of furniture i 've bought was the telephone . i 'll never take it away from my home .
 dear mrs maria smith ,
 i want to inform you that i had already talked to the author brown and he informed me about the aim .
 next week i will start organising some events for this few .
 the event will organize at the administration hotel .
 the same hotel that will you stay .
 yeah is opposite the park ' peace ' , which is near college .
 we chose that hotel because it is near college and we do n't need to use a transport .
 because you know where it is college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to hotel i think that is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the ' a week ' .
 the executive started at 0:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before .
 concerning the end - of - i 'm thinking about some dance and singing events .
 tell me your idea .
 about the clothes that we need to wear , must be uniform , because is the best pair to london and every year are coming from other colleagues .
 finally on the last day we have organised a shower - shirt around london . you will have the opportunity visiting some museums and zoo parks .
 i think it is a nice idea .
 if you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 000 - please , if you have more ideas send me a letter .
 yours sincerely ,
 nowadays all people have a telephone .
 the telephone is part of our life .
 it is one of the most important thing all over the world .
 the telephone is type of communication .
 if you want to talk with your friends , parents , partner or to ask something , you can call them without wondering how can communicate being with them .
 especially if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and every day and you do n't feel that they are far a way from you .
 today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone .
 they are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line .
 also you can leave a message if you call and ca n't find someone .
 the last type of telephone , is the mobile phone .
 you can use it everywhere and at any time .
 finally telephone except far from type of communication , is type and education .
 nowadays who are so nervous and we do n't have free time to see our friends , we can call them and talk or chat with them .
 especially the young people are using many hours the telephone and that is trouble for their parents .
 the telephone is very important investigation if we can use it centre without use it as type of the festival apply as they are doing now many people .
 dear mrs smith
 i have received your letter , which was about that you would like me to inform you .

 the party will be formal , therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress .

 power of computer .
 how much can a computer affect your life ? i think it is more than you think .
 when i was a child i always wanted to get the front of the songs that i liked , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
 i felt lack of them .
 i first bought a computer as i was in university .
 it was so necessary for me because i wanted to be a computer computer .
 that time i met the magic world of computers .
 referring to the internet was so popular .
 the internet was something amazing for me .
 can you think you have every information you need whenever you want ?
 can you think you contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
 i meet a lot of people on the internet and it really interested me .
 i learn a lot about their culture from them on the internet .
 i was n't able to imagine this before .
 in addition this , today companies can do nothing without a computer .
 everything in this world works with computers from now on .
 computers changed my lifestyle , my opinion about the world .
 and they affect everyone 's life 's visits or indirectly .
 dear mrs m. smith ,
 i am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested .
 first of all , the hotel is the mediter , 00th street , so that it is very easy to reach the management .

 have you ever thought thought to live without your car ?
 how can you manage your daily life without it ?
 i last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car .
 it is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
 on the other hand , this kind of restaurants has made our life more comfortable and easy .
 in fact we can go everywhere either either with friends or with our family and car wherever term and shopping magazines .
 cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey .
 for example , in the past it would have been extremely exhausting seconds military a hour but nowadays we have lots of big confusion and capable cars and a wide range of several option to choose with .
 however , i have to say that it has made people lazy and at the same time stressed due to traffic .
 on the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allow us travelling quickly .
 that 's why i could n't image my life without it .
 dear mrs maria smith ,
 thank you for your letter which i received last week .
 if student is ill , we will return the money but you should tell us one week before we started .
 and you are staying the lighting , which is located in town centre .
 you can take buses or our school buses .
 it costs - five .
 if you take public buses , it costs more expensive than school bus .
 the end - of - year is going to start from seven o'clock .
 one of our teacher , who will be scared by student is making a speech for one hour .
 after , student is making speech about what he or she learned learned and dinner .
 in my opinion , you should wear normal clothing .
 i would like to suggest that you should visit to the building of which is earlier on a second floor .
 there are fewer - designing , museums , g , g rep .
 this is very famous in our city .
 i hope that my advice will help you .
 i look forward to hearing from you .

 amazingly are not only part of the ticket east , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art gallery .
 who could have invented such a useful item ?
 in fact , nobody got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !
 the world is packed with so many disadvantages of chairs , from the ordinary ones to the most disastrous and comfort explaining , finding others finding finding finding finding finding a permanent range of prices .
 from my point of view the chair is without doubt the fact will be invented ever invented .
 some people use them in their work , others are stricter to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while a chair of the cheque of heat .
 although is worth say that no everybody can choose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .
 dear mrs smith ,
 thank you for your letter .
 i am glad to help you with the organisation of the normal .
 i phoned the tourist information last week and i got some information about the accommodation of the students .
 i think we should book at the lighting hotel .
 it is an exhausting building in the city centre .
 the hotel is in a good position , 00 minutes from the conferencing and i think the best way to attain it is on foot .
 i am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town .
 the middle starts at 0 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 0 pm .
 i think they should wear smart dress , because there will be lots of interesting people and important meeting .
 in conclusion , for the last day , i thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art .
 on the other hand , if you prefer to have a relaxing day , you could have a shower - player in the wonderful park .
 i hope my suggestion and idea will help you organise the meeting .
 i look forward to receiving your reply .

 however , you will take bus earlier , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .
 regarding the end - of - year parties , i would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit suit suit for a man , though it is no formal do .

 however , are you always happy when your personal phone rang .
 on the other hand i wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wo n't have your mobile switched on .
 this invention has affected my life completely .
 since i have been travelling around the world i would have imagined in tough with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone .

 inventions have affected all our lives !
 the invention without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car .
 cars have definitely changed all our lives , and i am not fun only in a positive way , but in a negative way as well .
 picture this : a big city such as london or new york with no cars on their streets .
 could you imagine it ?
 to be honest , i ca n't .
 cars are part of our daily lives .
 traffic makes people , sometimes really upset and embarrassed .
 but , anyway , people use cars .
 if we do n't use them we suffer from them .
 in my case i use public transport during the week to go to work but i could hardly imagine my weekends without my car car .
 i really need it to escape from pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other fashionable - renewable - renewabletery cure .
 is n't that any patience ?
 to go to the countryside and being able to breathe breathe breathe , non - polluted air , i use my car , which , as far as i am concerned did not help to a comparison air at all .
 therefore i am thinking in selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 00 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sorts of places , and changed my life for a new life : nuclear car nuclear car .
 dear mrs smith .
 i have just received your letter .

 .
 introduction .
 this report provides the information about visiting east , thanks , which is a doctor to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
 it reminds the cleaning history and the interest of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
 .
 history .
 the hundreds came up for 000 years and lasted until the beginning of 00th century .
 neither , was the main consequences of the royal family , so you will be able to imagine its size .
 as the kings of mine to be a part of nature , the ticket had a huge garden , however , it was destroyed by the army of japan , and now there only a part of the original bar .
 there is a special scene for the last month of the last month , who was killed by the japanese army .
 .
 activity .
 the reason why this is also popular for the youngsters , who deserve to dislike the historical visit , would be the various activity .
 you can try the traditional games of korea and there are a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the cables .
 also there are performances which held daily in the front gate of the ticket .
 .
 finally ibiza .
 it is out of question not to visit visiting east , circumstances , unless you do not want to know about korean history .
 you will find many interesting points there , therefore , i urge you to visit the place , if you want to experience the tradition of korea .
 dear mrs smith ,
 i am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about international student and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here .
 the group has been booked into the telephone hotel , which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take your students too much time to get to the town where the town is supposed to be repaired .
 the easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take social 000 ( the bus stop is to the hotel ) or we can hire a shower for you but there is an extra charge for it .
 there is a party on the last day of the courts .
 special prefers will be given to the students whose reports are the best .
 less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lot of music , dancing and fun are provided .
 please note that the distances computer switch are only sold until 00 pm .
 you can wear whatever you like for this kind of party .
 coming back to ideas and suggestions i'arena promised to give you about free afternoon before you catch your plane i can advise you to visit our or to for a wet couple of a park in a park trouble before you will go to the night party .
 yours sincerely ,
 can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with your life ?
 such a simple and cars things like a suspicious , a car , a computer , so only seem to be normal and spirit for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day .
 hundred years before people could n't even use an electric work not saying about a car or computer .
 they have invented improved improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one it is really so .
 some people say that many of important inventions in our lives are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .
 first of all , they say about pollution pollution which cars and other satellite - make , relax the electricity using pollution equipment and some others .
 but to my opinion if people inventions took a place in our lives they are right then .
 i think the inventions is the most important thing in many people ' lives as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone do n't matter wherever you are wherever i am talking about mobile which now have a majority of our choice ) .
 computers make everything faster so everything is now based on the computer systems .
 an electric forest was an important invention hundred years before ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) .
 i do n't think it will be possible to survive for us without an excursion life .
 because of development people could make all the ticket discoveries , and an petrol is undeniablely , certain hemingway of tea in our life .
 in case of all said i am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages 's alibi are much inventions all the disadvantages .
 dear mrs smith ,
 i have just read your letter and i am happy to help with giving you some further information .
 according to your first question , for the time of fame the students will be staying in the middle hotel , where the reservation has been already made .
 it is situated near to our college , about five minutes walk from the nearest station , which is south for renovation .
 as you were informed , there will be a party for all the assistants of the chinese , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
 surely the fact that it will be entirely more sociable i believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event .
 finally , answering your last question about the student 's day - out , i suggest visiting a local choir tennis and tennis tennis days as it is one of the best technological events .
 if you have any further questions , please , do not hesitate to contact me .
 i look forward to seeing you .
 yours sincerely ,

 i suggest that you wear a formal dress .
 there is some finger food and drinks .
 it might be a great party for end of fame .
 end of all , in my opinion we could go a centre of the town because there is many places to have a look and going shopping .
 it 's quite a nice and a suitable place to spend for three hours .
 it could be interesting for them .
 i am looking forward to hearing from you .
 yours sincerely ,
 imagine our life without a telephone .
 if a telephone haven't been invented , we would n't have lived perfectly like nowadays .
 would n't you think we rely on it more than we expect ?
 a telephone is used when we need to contact with someone , and also an emergency situation and an internet .
 it has various way to use , however , nowadays it is not only used by this intention , but also keeps it keeps our company .
 even if you feel alone , you can talk and hear from your friend easily .
 then it makes you happy .
 long time ago people lived without this perfect invention .
 but how ?
 they used to keep in touch with someone with a letter .
 in spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with , it was a only way .
 so that 's why they have invented a telephone .
 now we could feel the world closer and closer understanding of a telephone .
 who would n't thank you for this great invention ?
 dear madam ,
 i received your letter and i 'm pleased to answer your questions .
 m. brown has booked rooms in the telephone hotel .
 this is a first class hotel .
 the easiest way from the hotel to the development is with the bus .
 there is a bus stop in front of your hotel .
 take the bus in the future town .
 after four stops get off the bus .
 the name of this bus stop is ' fulfil 's boyfriend ' .
 if you leave the bus , the basis is in the house opposite the road .
 you ca n't miss it .
 afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco .
 for the disco you must n't wear blue jeans .
 finally at your last day i propose to do a sightseeing tour in our town .
 it takes you two hours .
 afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from switzerland .
 if you have any more questions , write back to me .
 yours sincerely ,
 i will write about the invention of the computer .
 with the computer our work is easier and more interesting .
 before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .
 when they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .
 with the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again . we could save the letter and in the three week we could send it another person .
 i work at a bank and i work all day with computers .
 if we hand n't ay one , we had to write all the patience on paper .
 if i order money for our bank with the computer i can be sure that i will arrive the day after .
 but if i had to write a letter and to send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days later .
 i have never worked without a computer , but if we did n't any we would find it true .

 the portable phone , a very useful invention !
 during all the history , there were a genius who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest inventions made .
 when the phone without a fire was invented , one was n't sure if it would be a success or not .
 but the research went on , and the portable phone is getting smaller and more useful .
 the fax phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .
 moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it .
 personally , the portable phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is saul at home , i do n't have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it 's too late .
 i recommend this extremely important invention who still do n't have a phone phone .
 dear maria ,
 i would be pleased to help you about all your questions and i will provide you some information which you need as much as i can .

 nothing will be a passion .

 everybody can put on something casual .
 before putting from england i suggest you visiting the desired and small inventions around . you could find the opportunity to see the country of the country life .
 yours sincerely ,
 time job
 i have to admit that the invented cars and transportation , made the most gard invention of the word .
 i say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our time passing so fast .

 maybe 00 times as quickly as getting somewhere on foot .
 try to imagine your life without having any explanation them .

 amazingly it would be just like mine .
 because i live in a special area far from any village , town , or city centre .
 the nearest takes me 0 hour on foot .
 i have no car , no local bus service to use .
 even comeing to sten , like a international trip to me .
 and of portable this stops me every time to live researcher life .
 but also i 'm aware of that the time for me . i must do whatever i want to be before it is too late .
 and i have to confess the invention of the car was the most useful invention for the humanity .

 there are many different people 's inventions around us .
 we are so used to them , sometimes think they existed always .
 some of them are very practical , others are rather strange .
 i think that one of the most important and affecting our life is the telephone .
 imagine life without phone .
 you are on the road , you have car accident .
 what are you going to do without phone ?
 on another situation , your son is ill , he needs help help work .
 i am sure , the phone has saved a lot of life .
 besides , it is always very nice to ring your ring or mum , only for shocked in any time .
 thanks the phone , it is possible even your country is on the other end of the earth .
 to be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you haven't got the phone .
 so i am very grateful to man , who invented it , because of the innovations , i have forgotten his name .
 it always happens with people , do n't ?
 try to ask who invented the will or the book .
 regarding hä - equipped , tuesday 00th june .
 dear mrs smith ,
 it is with great regret that i hear of mr brown 's illness , and hope to see him into an excellent health .
 nevertheless , i am both pleased and laughing to expect you and your group in the context of our international enthusiasm .

 my fair phone .
 the technological revolution taking place today can be directly to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities abilities finish them last few years .
 the japanese invention of this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
 it is clear and that the use of this invention has become a necessary related in some professional activities .
 fell , politicians and a few examples are but a few examples of such needs .
 however , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of high high - school student .
 it becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during lessons , during lunch and especially , during the examinations ...
 nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the fifteenth purpose of such andez is to arrange during the class during its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday 's courses .
 bottom is that any teacher complain about this situation should not the student 's phone , but his parents ' !

 if you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant conducted on our lives .
 for example , all the newspapers such as madam and energy are ran using computers uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all of services and thousands of different illnesses such as horse and use them as essential years .
 in other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers .
 so i am sure from this that it is professional enough to say that invention of computers is really important .
 from my personal experience , i can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool .
 it reminds of my homework , which is often to write , and also it allows me to access the internet .
 since i live abroad , the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my best friend and to know what is going on in my home country .
 to sum up , i can say that the greatest story is the invention of computers , that has affected both education and a society as a whole .

 have you ever thought about a world without phone ?
 how was it in the 00 century with no opportunity to communicate by phone and how it would now be now ?
 i can not imagine how our life would be .
 we are living in a busy world .
 in the business world you use the phone all the time to speak to your clients , to make a shower , to order to order an article instance , ok ; then , time is money !
 how has the phone affected my own life ? i think that is a good question to think about . i could not call my friends from another city and just say " hello " .
 it would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
 so , what did the phone - revolution for us ?
 it saves time .

 yours faithfully ,
 dear mrs smith ,
 i 'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you , in order to let you know all the information you have asked for .
 first of all , your group has been booked into the hotel , main - 00 , which is situated not far from our college .
 i 'd suggest you to walk , it will only take you about seven minutes .
 just follow the main - until to reach a east , where you turn right and then walk along - a - shirt - tempered - day .
 the college is a huge , yellow - you ca n't miss it .

 last but not least i will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon .

 yours sincerely ,
 the telephone , a telephone .
 who you could imagine life without the telephone ?
 not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in a moment ?
 not being able to lie to your mother - in - law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
 when surely bell , first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
 it was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
 nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
 take me , for example , i use it whenever there is a problem and i need some advice , or when i have to call off a meeting for any reason why .
 i can not always walk to the person and say " sorry , i must cancel our meeting " , because then it 's too late anyway , anyway , is n't it ?
 life definitely would n't be the same without the invention of the telephone .
 we use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on .
 just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all , and you will see that it is impossible to do so .
 so do n't take the telephone for granted , but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention .
 dear mrs smith ,
 i would like to thank you for your letter .
 i am sorry to learn that cultural brown can not attend the conferencing .
 please phoned him my best wishes for his patience .
 we have booked rooms for all members of your group at the telephone hotel .
 it is a very appealing that is on the same scene as the chinese building , and normally one mile away .
 there is a hurry brown between the two east : this is bus ; the bus station ; the bus station for the development building is called " isolation " and the one at the middle centuries hotel is named " main station " .
 concerning the party , we do not have a casual dressing .
 students usually wear dark clothes with a peaceful for the boys and a teenager - long skirt or dress for the girls .
 there are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon .
 i would like to suggest visiting the " friday museum , which is kind of unique in the world .
 looking forward to meeting you soon
 i remain yours sincerely .
 the car :
 i think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life from people from industrial countries .
 nowadays more than the newspapers of the world industry is related to the east cars : cars , thanks , and hundreds , hoover and newspapers , and so on .
 the industrial machines have deepona from their peace since the car has been available to everyone .
 at the beginning of the last century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one .
 today almost everyone 's car and needs it for daily activities .
 the transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
 the increasing number of cars and newspapers are now now synthetic problems .
 a lot of roads and cars are , and environment are more and more related to the use cars and more related to the fifteenth of cars .
 people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without their consequences .
 this will be a tough challenge for this new century .
 dear mrs smith :
 my name is delightful , i am helping to organise the knowledge in the college .
 i received your letter the other day and i am writing to answer your questions .
 the group has been booked into the hotel , which is not very far from the place where the phone will be held .
 you can take the no ideas from the hotel to the chinese , it only takes ten minutes .
 as for the end - of - 's parties , it will be on the morning of the last day starting start at 0:00 .
 all the students and staff will join together in the hall .
 they can play games and talk about personal experience .
 the main aim of it is to discover the friendships among all these pupils coming from all over the world .
 so it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart .
 i have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you .
 if you are free i will show you for our college .
 you can visit our - built science developments as well .
 i 'm sure you will surely a lot of knowledge there .
 i 'm looking forward to meeting you .
 best wishes .
 best choice
 welcome to london .
 you asked me for an interesting building to visit .
 in my opinion , i 'll recommend for the british museum .
 one of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about british history there .
 the museum looks very old as some other buildings in london , but it is very modern inside .
 after going through the enormous door , you can see a huge white building , which is a library .
 a lot of famous people have been to this library before !
 the british hall is on the first floor , not far from the library .
 it shows a large number of valuable things .
 almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about british history .
 i 'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson !
 apart from the history history , there are more content about the past of the world .
 you can go to many sections such as the plane hall , a vending hall , and so on .
 countless fascinating things will definitely take you the whole day to appreciate .
 after a visit to british museum , you will certainly be able to put your history - five away !
 also you do n't have to pay any money for it , and the transport is extremely convenient , therefore british is your best choice . do n't be more comfortably !
 dear mrs smith .

 it does n't matter what kind of mood i am , i can do it all the time and it makes me feel good .
 but i could n't possibly without an oven oven .
 i 'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion .
 i think the oven is one of the most important inventions .
 if there is someone who does n't agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven .
 besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she carried .
 i 'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the microwave is a really important invention for our lives .
 i 'm thanking the person who invented the oven oven .
 thank you !
 dear mrs. smith ,
 i am writing in reply to your letter .
 i am sorry about the biggest brown .

 if you have more questions about the planes and something else , do not hesitate to ask me . i would be glad to be able to help you .
 yours sincerely ,
 some inventions are not professional as great things even though life without them can not be imagined .
 people do not have the impression on important inventions any more , because they have been getting more popular and common .
 however , there is something which is still believed that it was an unpleasantinging invention .
 this is electricity invented by patience .
 from my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , and the field which are used in modern times can be clear with only electricity , which makes people not too much opportunities .
 what is more , many inventions have been recommended by electricity .
 in my life , i use electricity in many different ways .
 at night , i can study because of it . and also it saves my saves time which would be used up for doing housework such as warm , cleaning and ironing .
 it makes my life more convenient than it without it .
 to sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .

 nowadays , our lives is becoming better and better .
 lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfort .
 if you ask me which is the greatest invention of all , i will say that it is the television .
 " televisions is just an amazing invention . " my good friend said that i agree with her .
 firstly , televisions makes us know more about the world without travel it all .
 if there are no televisions , we wo n't know what are the other countries like , or even what language they speak to either we go to that country .
 secondly , for some points , it can be a young children .
 many tv communicate are especially made for children , such as " learn me " and " be good to others " .
 actually , they are quite good contact and helped me know what i should do generally or how to revise to lie when i was still a child .
 the last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainment .
 maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to the owner and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object .
 however , televisions can bring you the fun that other activities ca n't .
 if sometimes i do n't want to go out and i do n't want to be lonely , that 's easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .
 however , everything has its advantages and disadvantages .
 personally , i do think televisions is the most important invention .
 dear mrs. maria smith .

 moreover we can not live without them .
 for example : electricity , computer , tele , fell , boat , cars ( a puncture ) , etc .

 if you look at home , there are a lot of electrical things .
 electricity could be able to invent other things .
 it also gave us more free time , especially for women .
 it has absolutely women 's house our house working time .

 nowadays people have become acquainted to watching karaoke . 's unbelievable every day .
 the tv is so important that you can see it in every family , and it is a essential equipment for everyone .
 first of all , in my opinion , tv has a great education , and also makes the world become small .
 you can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment .
 i would rather watching the news on tv in the face of reading in newspaper or listen on radio because the news on tv are watching .
 moreover , the tv is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone . i would like to open tv when i stay at home .
 someone are talking , talking , crying on there , so join them , you will feel much better than just yourself .
 some tv express are unique !
 however , tv also has some disadvantages .
 you just sitting in front of tv for hours learn nothing , or no more talk with your family .
 i think this is the bad influence in society .
 in the end , the tv has both advantages and disadvantages , microwaves , but on the whole advantages is better than disadvantages .
 so , but on the whole , tv still is a wonderful and important invention on the world .
 dear mrs smith ,
 i am writing to you to give you more information about an international student .
 the group has been booked into industrial hotel at high street , which is very easy to find .
 and the best way to get from there to the executive is following the rod of the hotel to the right , then cross the world to the opposite to the opposite .
 after that walk to the right about 00 metres and you will find the conferencing of which is called white house .
 at the end of the end , we are going to have an international dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college .
 as this is a special item so you could wear your own national dress to present your country .
 finally , on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall , which you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping centre at high street .

 it is called pen , as the building will tell you all about patience .
 on the positive side , you and the group will be thankful to learn more about the art work which are presented on the wall , on the door and some research .
 the building itself looks catherine and beautiful .
 on the other hand , you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old - shirt which causes some noise .
 and some old story might look peaceful .
 but in my recommendation , i think it would be nice for the students to get and see this building .
 because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country .
 as a scientist is not modern america , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old thing .
 yours sincerely ,

 computers is the most important invention in our life .
 some people might say the electricity more important than another thing .
 it 's hard to say which is the most important invention .
 however , i 'd say computers is more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone , the car .
 recently computer is really necessary and we ca n't manage to work without them .
 not only is for checking , but also in my life .
 for instance , when i want to flee with my friend , it 's quite helpful by using e - mail - mail .
 before the computer had been invented , we could n't possibly have lots of information easily and we could n't contact with foreign countries in the same time .
 and also it 's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple , so far more people can enjoy computers more than before .
 despite amazing invention , some times makes a big problem , such as television ( some people called " 0000 problem " , because computer not like a human 's brain .
 however , the computer is worth to use in our life until more peaceful machine will be invented .

 the telephone a very important invention
 in my early childhood my mother said to me that when she had been a thief girl there was only one telephone in the house where she had lived .
 it has been in her parents ' apart .
 the neighbours had come into to make their balloons and to get their calls .
 today nobody could imagine such a situation .
 in every school there is a telephone at least .
 there are a lot of advantages for it .
 firstly people are able to talk to person on every time : it is just for fun or also discuss some important and relevant - .
 moreover we always can call to help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
 this could save life !
 another advantage is that all the offices , and entrance could not add without it .
 of course there is also a big disadvantage .
 all people know this situation ; people do not want to be interrupted . maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little ... then the telephone ... !
 it is not an easy disadvantage how to react now .
 being repaired , most of us would go to the telephone .
 another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are suspended , everywhere and on every time .
 especially neither this kind of invention .
 to sum up this invention is one of the most useful things .
 it is always the same how to people use it or not and how people handle it .
 dear mrs maria smith

 as it is known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 00th century , nevertheless i believe that the most important one is the computer is the computer .
 it is a fact that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
 taking it into consideration i would like to say that the computer is the lighting for an wet , designers , billy , and so on and on .
 another point in favour is the opportunity to connect to the internet .
 it allows you to have all the necessary information " on your colleagues " .
 also not least is the role of computers in the process of world in the world .
 on the other hand there are some disadvantages .
 for instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .
 another task is that in computers 's computers , which keeps to the increasing of unemployment .
 to conclude i would like to say that the entrance list of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so - called " problem " if the computer had not been so important for the modern society .
